## Requirements

- node v18.x
- pnpm v7.15.x
- docker
- docker-compose v2.19.x

## Run locally in development mode

Install required dependencies

```bash
  pnpm install
```

For local development every service will use ```.env.development.local``` file, which is not included on this repository, every service has its own ```.env.example.local``` with the example environment variables that can be used for development proposes

```bash
  cd services/{service}
  cp .env.example.local .env.development.local
```

Some services will need an specific infrastructure, in that case there is a docker compose file with the infrastructure required for every service for example for the authentication service (`services/auth`) will run Redis, Postgres and another docker-compose file with Kafka and Zookeeper.

```bash
  pnpm run deploy:local:auth
```

Some services will use a Database like Postgres for those services there is an script to run required migrations (This will run ```migrate``` script on every service where the script is defined)

```bash
pnpm run migrate
```

The following command will run every service with nodemon on watch mode also will use `tsup` on watch mode for every package with the dev script defined

```bash
  pnpm run dev
```

## Useful commands

Transpile and build every package and service where ```build``` script is defined

```bash
  pnpm run build
```

Run every package and service on development mode

```bash
  pnpm run dev
```

Run every service builded with the ```start``` script defined

```bash
  pnpm run start
```

Run linter for every project

```bash
  pnpm run lint
```

Fix all autofixable linter errors for every project

```bash
  pnpm run lint:fix
```

Runs migrations for every service with that script defined

```bash
  pnpm run migrate
```

Runs migrations rollback for every service with that script defined

```bash
  pnpm run rollback
```

Deploy all the infrastructure required for ```services/auth``` including the auth service using docker compose

```bash
  pnpm run deploy:local:auth
```

Shutdown all the infrastructure required for ```services/auth``` including the auth service using docker-compose

```bash
  pnpm run down:local:auth
```

Runs every project clean script if it is defined, used to delete ```dist``` and ```node_modules``` folders

```bash
  pnpm run clean
```
